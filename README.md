# udacity_drl_colaboration_competition

This repository contains the codes for the project Collaboration and Competition submission.They are

- actor and critic model weights for the two competing actor-critic maddpgs:
    - `checkpoint_actor_0.pth`: first agent actor network
    - `checkpoint_critic_0.pth`: first agent critic network
    - `checkpoint_actor_1.pth`: second agent actor network
    - `checkpoint_critic_1.pth`: second agent critic network
- added maddpg model (`maddpg_agent.py`) 
- actor network and critic networks architectures (`model.py`)
- added tracked training results (time spend training, scores evolution)  **(`INSERT_NAME_HERE.sav`)**
- added the jupyter notebook used to train the agent (`Tennis.ipynb`)
